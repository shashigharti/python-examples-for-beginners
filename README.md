Python Practice For Beginners

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project Overview:
-----------------

This repo contains python coding examples for beginners. I will be adding practice projects
with varying difficulty levels. These examples will be a mix of problem solving, datastructure
and machine learning problems. I started this to practice machine learning and refine my python 
skills. I hope this will be helpful to others who are at the beginners level and want to improve
their coding skills.
