    "\n",
    "I created this notebook to practice and play with the basic concept of binomial distribution by implementing the theoritical concept explained in the video. In this video, the author takes an example of positive and negative reviews from the customer and explains the underlying principles to finding the true success rate i.e maximizing the probability of a good experience. \n",

    "To simulate the data, we will use random number between 0 to 1. Any number less than 0.95 is a positive review and viceversa."
